\usage{
workflow(ext, occurrenceModule, covariateModule, processModule, modelModule,
  mapModule)
}
\arguments{
\item{ext}{A numeric vector of length 4 giving the coordinates of the
rectangular region within which to carry out the analysis, in the
order: xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax.}

\item{occurrenceFn}{The name of the function (module) to be used to get occurence data}

\item{covariateFn}{The name of the function (module) to be used to get covariate data}

\item{processFn}{The name of the function (module) to be used to process the data}

\item{modelFn}{The name of the SDM model function (module) to be used}

\item{mapFn}{The name of the function (module) to be used to map output}
}
\value{
A list with the extent, the results of each module and a copy of the
      code used to execute the workflow (what's there now should be source-able
      though I'm sure there is a much neater approach than the one I took - the
      ultimate aim would be a much nicer way of enhancing reproducibility).
