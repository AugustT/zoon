Description: This is a *really* rough sketch of a modular structure for the
    ZOON workflow. In this version, a workflow consists of 5 types of modules,
    representing the key steps in an SDM workflow: occurrence module covariate
    module process module model module map module The user must select one
    module for each of these module types. These are then passed to the
    workflow wrapper function which runs through each step. Every module type
    should have a protocol determining what it takes as input and what it gives
    as output. Different modules for each module type could be stored in a
    community repositories, enabling users to quickly drop in a newly developed
    model or processing step and run it with their data. The structure also
    makes it very easy to compare different models against a standard dataset.
    These modules are just functions and wherever possible they should be self-
    contained, taking no arguments other than those used in the workflow.
    Clearly this is very simplistic, obvious next steps include modules for
    validation statistics and plots, the ability to predict to different
    covariate rasters than are used to train the model, etc.
